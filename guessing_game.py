# Import the random and statistics modules.
import random
from statistics import mean
from statistics import median
from statistics import mode

# Create the start_game function.
start_game = input("Hi there, welcome to 'The Number Guessing Game!'\nWould you like to play?\ny or n?")
if start_game.lower() == "y":
    print("Great! Please choose a number between 1 and 100...")

# Write your code inside this function.

#   When the program starts, we want to:
#   ------------------------------------
#   1. Display an intro/welcome message to the player.
#   2. Store a random number as the answer/solution.
#   3. Continuously prompt the player for a guess.
#     a. If the guess is greater than the solution, display to the player "It's lower".
#     b. If the guess is less than the solution, display to the player "It's higher".

#   4. Once the guess is correct, stop looping, inform the user they "Got it" and store the number of guesses it took in a list.
#   5. Display the following data to the player
#     a. How many attempts it took them to get the correct number in this game
#     b. The mean of the saved attempts list
#     c. The median of the saved attempts list
#     d. The mode of the saved attempts list
#   6. Prompt the player to play again
#     a. If they decide to play again, start the game loop over.
#     b. If they decide to quit, show them a goodbye message.

# ( You can add more features/enhancements if you'd like to. )


# Kick off the program by calling the start_game function.
